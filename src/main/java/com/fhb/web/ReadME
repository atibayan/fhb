7/1: Dto is data transfer object. The reason why we do this is to control the data that will be exposed to
the View/front end… for instance the model for user contains “private” data like password. These aren’t needed by
 frontend/ui so we remove it through DTOs…. Technically we can live without them by directly using the model itself
  but a better design is to do it via Dtos. I will update the read me.
